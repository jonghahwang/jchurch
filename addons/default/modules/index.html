1 Peter 2:9 
You are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God, that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light.

1. Holy nation - distinct, different from the world and the people around us.
2. Royal priesthood - priests are mediator, counselor and someone who take care of the needs of the people. deeply involved int eh lives of the world and the people around us.

The centrality of community

1. You cannot know God apart from community. (This is why you have to go to church)
2. You cannot change deeply apart from community. (community is a place where you can change)
